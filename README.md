## Introduction

Most people actually possess a considerable amount of useful information that can be used to help others, like the number of people in the waiting line of some restaurant, or the valuable advices for people in workplace or schools. However, most platforms on the Internet donâ€™t facilitate the sharing of these kinds of information, they either lack incentive, encourage too much subjective ideas, or simply don't provide a suitable structure to host and distribute the informations. As a result, these information that could potentially help plenty of people, usually ended up helping only few of their friends or just themselves.

To address this problem, we created **infoBank**.

infoBank is an innovative, general-purposed information sharing platform, where people actively share and receive useful information. We integrated the concept of free market and reputation mechanism into the Internet, and leveraged the ubiquity and convenience of smartphone, boosting the supply and circulation of useful information. With each pieces of information utilized, true *information sharing economy* can finally be fulfilled.

## Motive

We often encounter a specific inconvenience: wanting to eat in a popular restaurant but worrying that there might be too many people in the waiting line. In these kind of scenarios, one may intuitively think,  "How good would it be if somehow a stranger there could simply share the number of people waiting with us through the internet?".
The unfortunate truth is, no existing platform can help us with that.

After deeper contemplation, we realized that most people have plenty of similar need, things like academic Q&A, available parking spot, regulations of places (e.g. reservation procedure, COVID related), whether a shop is closed today and the rating for any merchandise or seller.

Moreover, some organizations may spend tons of resources to build and maintain a new website or APP, just to provide several kinds of information, like information about Ubike, garbage truck position or university enrollment, since they don't actually need customized UI design, and the information can easily fit into several categories of formats, we believe that there must be a way to unify them. As for the other means of information sharing, like social platforms, forums, search engine, blogs and news, its problem is that its major incentive is just the joy of sharing or the sense of achievement, and even if it does provide real incentives like money, the reward is usually proportionate to just the *number of views*, regardless of whether the information is actually helpful or easy to locate and use.

Considering the great problem and immense potential, we have been determined to create a brand new platform, a more unified space where the incentive is real and positively correlated to one's contribution to the community.
